This repository contains all the scripts for an AI image detection CSSL NN I am training.

Images are fed to diffusion models as latents - a distilled representation of the image that allows processing with reduced overhead. This is facilitated by a variational autoencoder (VAE), a neural network that encodes/decodes between images and latents. Because decoding by VAE is a lossy process, and a process that is currently used in all major, modern image generation implementations, it seems like an obvious candidate for detecting AI generated images.

I aim to demonstrate this effect in the following VAE's:

## Priority
These models represent a diverse range of commonly used VAE's.
[SDXL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-vae): [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/joshuajewell/VAEDecodedImages-SDXL) [model]()
[DALLÂ·E](https://github.com/openai/dall-e): [dataset]() [model]()
[FLUX](https://huggingface.co/StableDiffusionVN/Flux/tree/main/Vae): [dataset]() [model]()

## Other
These models are either incredibly popular but may be similar to SDXL or are old SD models with less relevance today.
